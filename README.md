## REVIEW :: Basic Git Workflow

Although you've all been using Git and Github for over a month, it's still worthwhile to take a look at some of the core ideas of Git.

#### Q: Why Use Version Control?
When you're working on a project, you sometimes want to be able to retrace your steps, or even revert your project to a previous state.  And often (particularly in the workplace) you need a way to effectively collaborate on a single project without stepping on each others' toes. Version control tools address all of these needs.

#### Q: Why Git?
Git, apart from being free and open source, is also in many ways a superior system to many older version control tools (such as Subversion) because it is a "distributed" version control tool. This means that there is no centralized approval structure for making changes to the project; instead, every person who clones the repository has their own complete copy, which they can then edit and change. This makes it much easier to use when working in groups.

>In addition, Git is much better at handling branching and merging, two big topics we'll be covering today.

#### Q: How Does Git Work?
Git works by creating ['snapshots'](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics), which record the current state of a repo. Each snapshot represents the state of the project at some moment in time.

To create a new snapshot, we use `git add` to select (or "stage") a file or files that have changed since our last snapshot, and `git commit` to actually create a new snapshot which includes those changes.

As a rule of thumb, when working full-time on a project you should make at least three commits a day, and probably closer to five or ten. Yes, really!
